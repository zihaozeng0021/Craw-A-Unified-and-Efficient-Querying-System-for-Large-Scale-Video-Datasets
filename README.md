# **Craw: A Unified and Efficient Querying System for Large-Scale Video Datasets**

This includes the baselines, video datasets and the core code of our system

To ensure the confidentiality of our research, we have not fully open-sourced the experimental testing code of Craw. Currently, only the code related to the overall architecture of Craw has been made publicly available. We promise to release all the code in the future.
